We are creating a mobile app that allows a user to resize and upload photos. You need to
create a Media Service API for image processing.

##The main app functions:

● The user can use the mobile app to upload an image and pass resize parameters. In
response, they will receive an object with links to resized image and original.

● User can see a list of their earlier resized images with resizing results and resizing
parameters.

● User can resize old image one more time passing old image id and new resize
parameters.

● microservice has to return information about all errors in proper format for invalid user inputs.

● microservice images should be returned as an object with links to resized and original image.

##Requirements
● You need to implement microservice and documentation for it.

● You can use any third party libraries.

● You must use any of cloud hosting providers for storing files (AWS/GCP/Digital
Ocean).

● You can use any SQL/NoSQL database.

● Results should be presented in the public GitHub repository.

##We will rate
● technology stack choice

● code quality

● git workflow

● test coverage

Before you start, please provide a list of technologies you will use and an estimate (how long
it will take you to complete the task).
